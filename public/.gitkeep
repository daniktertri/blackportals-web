# Public Folder

This folder contains static assets that can be accessed directly from your Next.js application.

## Usage

Place your images, screenshots, and other static files here. They can be referenced in your code using paths starting with `/`.

### Examples:

- `/screenshot1.jpg` → `public/screenshot1.jpg`
- `/images/app-screen.png` → `public/images/app-screen.png`
- `/screenshots/hero.jpg` → `public/screenshots/hero.jpg`

### In your code:

```jsx
// Regular img tag
<img src="/screenshot1.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

// Next.js Image component
import Image from 'next/image'
<Image src="/screenshot1.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width={400} height={800} />
```

## Recommended Structure

You can organize your files like this:
- `public/screenshots/` - For app screenshots
- `public/images/` - For other images
- `public/icons/` - For icons
- `public/favicon.ico` - For favicon
